# github-actions-demo
This repo is a demo for scraping on a schedule with GitHub Actions. It's a work in progress.

## What's happening?
We're using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to scrape calls for service from Oakland, CA. It's the same information you can find [here](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgismaps.oaklandca.gov%2Foaklandgis%2Frest%2Fservices%2Fcallforservice_2015_FC%2FFeatureServer%2F0&source=sd), but in CSV form. If you'd like more information, [here's all we know about the Data Source](https://airtable.com/shrUAtA8qYasEaepI/tblx8XaKnFTphWNQM/viw9mmOR0fw8HFOje/rec993D5V56tjO2UB).
